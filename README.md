# Blockchain Assignment 2 Project

Made by: Alinur Zhumadil 

Task: AI Model Marketplace dApp

Description: This is a project to create a decentralized marketplace for AI models using smart contracts and Web3.js integration on the frontend. The project uses Hardhat to develop and deploy smart contracts, and Web3.js to interact with the blockchain via a web browser.

## Key Features

1. **List Models**: Users can upload AI models with a name, description, and price.
   
   - Function: `listModel(name, description, price)`
   - Description: Upload a model with a unique ID, name, description, price, and creator info.

2. **Purchase Models**: Users can buy models if the payment matches the price.

   - Function: `purchaseModel(modelId)`
   - Description: Buy a model and transfer funds to the creator.

3. **Rate Models**: Users can rate models from 1 to 5.

   - Function: `rateModel(modelId, rating)`
   - Description: Rate a model, updating its average rating.

4. **Withdraw Funds**: The contract owner can withdraw the funds from the contract.

   - Function: `withdrawFunds()`
   - Description: Allows the owner to withdraw all funds in the contract.

5. **Get Model Details**: Get information about a model like its name, description, price, creator, and rating.

   - Function: `getModelDetails(modelId)`
   - Description: Retrieve details of a model by its ID.

## Data Structure

**Model (struct)**:  
Each model is stored with the following information:

```solidity
struct Model {
    string name; // Name of the model
    string description; // Description of the model
    uint256 price; // Price of the model
    address creator; // Creator's address
    uint8 rating; // Average rating of the model
    uint256 ratingCount; // Number of ratings
}
